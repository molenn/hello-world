# hello-world

_M@'s development playground and test repository for GitHub._

This is, for now, my only public repo and is what I'm going to be using to (kind of) journal my work.

In the Fall of 1994, I took ART300 - _Beyond MTV_ at Syracuse University and created my first web page as the final project. The instructor, [Donal Little](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donal-little-9331137/), was (and still is) a futurist who was blown away by the potential of the World Wide Web and was trying to convince us undergrads - who were mostly pessimistic about the opportunities that the economic resession had waiting for us after graduation - that it was going to be a transformational medium. He was so _hyped_ that someone was able to use the technology that I got an A in the class, _despite having slept through the midterm_. That was my first inkling of the power of the internet and web application development.

I graduated in 1996 with a BFA in Illustration and wandered around Manhattan with my portfolio for a couple of weeks, trying to find work. I mostly got solicitations from other illustrators and graphic designers asking if I could please let them know if I had any work I could pass through to them. One company, Yahoo Inc., liked my digital illustration enough to offer me at _$23K starting salary_. I didn't see why a search engine would need an illustrator and I didn't see how I could live in Manhattan on $23K per year.

I called my cousin [Adam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-olenn/), who seemed to be doing well in the Washington DC area. He asked if I knew anything about computers. I told him I knew the typical creative apps (i.e., Photoshop, Illustrator, Quark XPress, etc.), Unix, and some HTML. He laughed and told me to come down, crash on the floor of his room in Arlington, VA, and help him at his company while I looked for a job. The first day on the job with him, he pulled out a crate of files from his recent job search. He selected seven folders from places that he'd liked, picked up the phone, and called each contact saying, "Hey, it's Adam Olenn: I interviewed with you recently. I've accepted a position, but I wanted to know if you still needed someone with web development skills because I have a great candidate."

Those seven calls led to seven interviews. Those seven interviews led to seven offers. I picked the one that paid the most.

That was just a shade under _29 years ago_. Since that time I built web pages for BellAtlantic.net, an AOL-like internet portal for their dialup service. I learned relational databases, server administration, and dynamic website construction while working for the defense contractor Veridian. I tried the e-commerce start-up route with the online pet pharmacy VetCentric. I joined boutique contractor SRA International and built backend web applications for the Environmental Protection Agency's EnergySTAR program. Then I was pulled into a contract with the Office of Personnel Management as a Tech Lead for a systems modernization project.

After a couple of years as a Tech Lead, I got married, bought a house, and started a family. My role shifted away from hands-on development. I got an MS in Software Engineering and an MBA to understand leadership better. I entered the civil service with OPM as a Technical Project Manger. A few years later, I left OPM to run an IT Project Management Office with the Small Business Administration. I'm currently performing IT policy analysis and acquisitions at the [First Responders Network Authority](https://www.firstnet.gov/), where I find myself doing a little bit of business automation and data engineering, but mostly IT procurement.

Holy shit...fucking _kill me_.

I did not go through all of this to liquefy my brain renewing the same enterprise software packages year after year.

I miss software development. I love software engineering and piecing together solutions using code. Solving a problem, seeing it work, building it up bit by bit is incredibly rewarding and I want to spend more time doing it.

My goal for this account is to build a code base of web applications that I can draw from and share with others. I plan to take on some freelance projects and build up a slick portfolio. My son is also getting into programming and is dying to create some video games, so we may collaborate on that. He's nine, so I can't tell how interested he'll be in the idea a week from now, but he keeps wandering over to see what I'm building and he's asking me for help with his Scratch projects.

I'm still feeling out the landscape, so my near-term plans are:

1. Get up to speed on in-demand components of modern web application stacks, particularly JavaScript, Node.js, TypeScript, and React.
2. Get up to speed on continuous integration between GitHub and cloud service providers (currently running apps on Vercel and DigitalOcean).
3. Refresh my experience with Python, MySQL, PostGreSQL, HTML, and CSS.
4. Push data engineering and visualization ideas further
5. Get [Foolserrand.com](http://www.foolserrand.com/), the domain I've had registered since 1996, up and running as a personal site. It's currently hosted on SquareSpace (by default when they took over Google Domains) and I'll point it to one of the CSP's described in #2 above.
6. Create an interactive skill gap heatmap application and some other online tools to replicate the stuff I've built for myself in Excel (e.g., burn-down chart, RACI matrix, etc.).
7. Somethingsomething...AI.

We'll see how it goes from here. It feels good to be typing in fixed-width again. :)
