# hello-world
*M@'s development playground and test repository for GitHub.*

After having gone on hiatus from full-stack web development for a few years to run an IT Project Management Office with the Small Business Administration and, currently, performing IT policy analysis and acquisitions at the [First Responders Network Authority](https://www.firstnet.gov/), I'm getting back into coding.  I love software development and piecing together solutions.  Solving a problem, seeing it work, building it up bit by bit is incredibly rewarding and I want to spend more time doing it.

My goal for this account is to build a code base of web applications that I can draw from and share with others.  I plan to take on some freelance projects and build up a slick portfolio.  My son is also getting into programming and is dying to create some video games, so we may collaborate on that.  He's six, so I can't tell how interested he'll be in the idea a week from now.

I'm still feeling out the landscape, so my near-term plans are:
1. Build a Python project.
2. Get [Foolserrand.com](http://www.foolserrand.com/), the domain I've had registered since 1996, up and running as a personal site.
3. Create an interactive skill gap heatmap application and some other online tools to replicate the stuff I've built for myself in Excel (e.g., burn-down chart, RACI matrix, etc.).

We'll see how it goes from here.  It feels good to be typing in fixed-width again. :)
